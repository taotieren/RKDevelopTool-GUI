# RKDevelopTool GUI

[中文](README.zh.md) | English

RKDevelopTool GUI is a graphical front-end for Rockchip's official rkdeveloptool. It provides an intuitive interface to perform firmware flashing, partition management, and device debugging tasks without using the command line.

**Mode Switching** - Quick buttons to enter Maskrom or Loader mode, and to reboot the device.

**Real-time Logging** - View command execution logs and flashing progress in real time.

## Download (recommended)

Prebuilt packages are attached to every [GitHub Release](https://github.com/gahingwoo/RKDevelopTool-GUI/releases).
They **bundle `rkdeveloptool`**, so there is nothing else to install.

| Platform | File |
| --- | --- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `RKDevelopTool-GUI-arm64.dmg` |
| Linux (portable, x86_64 / arm64) | `RKDevelopTool-GUI-*-x86_64.AppImage` / `*-aarch64.AppImage` |
| Debian/Ubuntu (amd64 / arm64) | `rkdeveloptool-gui_*.deb` |
| Fedora/openSUSE (x86_64 / aarch64) | `rkdeveloptool-gui-*.rpm` |

> **macOS note:** the app is not notarized yet, so on first launch macOS may say
> it "cannot be opened". Right-click the app → **Open** → **Open**, or run
> `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/RKDevelopTool-GUI.app`.

## Install via pip

Install a standard Python wheel — this adds the `rkdeveloptool-gui` command to
your `PATH`. Unlike the prebuilt packages above, the wheel does **not** bundle
`rkdeveloptool`, so install that separately (see [Running from source](#running-from-source)
for the requirements).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gahingwoo/RKDevelopTool-GUI
cd RKDevelopTool-GUI
pip install .
rkdeveloptool-gui
```

Or build a redistributable wheel and install it anywhere:

```bash
pip install build
python -m build --wheel
pip install dist/rkdeveloptool_gui-*.whl
```

---

## Running from source

If you run from source instead of a prebuilt package, you need:

- Python 3.8 or later, PySide6 (Qt 6 for Python)
- `rkdeveloptool` installed and on PATH — verify with `rkdeveloptool --version`
  ([installation instructions](https://docs.radxa.com/en/zero/zero3/low-level-dev/rkdeveloptool))

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gahingwoo/RKDevelopTool-GUI
cd RKDevelopTool-GUI
pip install -r requirements.txt
python rkdevtoolgui.py
```

### Build Standalone Executable

```bash
python build_nuitka.py
./rkdevtoolgui
```

### Arch Linux

Available in AUR:
```bash
yay -S rkdeveloptool-gui
```

Or through a community repository:
```bash
sudo pacman -S rkdeveloptool-gui
```

For the packaging status across more distributions, please refer to [Repology](https://repology.org/project/rkdeveloptool-gui/versions)

Alternatively, you can install it via a [self-hosted package repository](https://github.com/taotieren/aur-repo)
